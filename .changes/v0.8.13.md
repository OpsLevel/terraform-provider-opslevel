## [November 17, 2023](https://github.com/OpsLevel/terraform-provider-opslevel/compare/v0.8.12...v0.8.13)
### Bugfix
- Fix a bug with opslevel_service owner and owner_alias creating infinite plan loops
- Fix a bug with opslevel_team not handling managed aliases correctly
### Refactor
- Refactor task file so that it works building the provider consistently
- opslevel_team.aliases field is now required - you can supply the default alias that would be generated and we'll handle not reconciling it properly or you can just specify aliases you want to manage
### Removed
- Removed opslevel_team.alias field to support only the .aliases field
