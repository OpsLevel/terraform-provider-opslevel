kind: Bugfix
body: Fixed bug in filter predicates where making some filters like on
  repository_ids was impossible because of bool 'case_sensitive' being
  required. To toggle case_sensitive use 'case_sensitive = true' or
  'case_insensitive = true'. A bug still persists where case sensitivity
  cannot be disabled when updating a predicate. The workaround is to
  manually set the predicate to null in Graphiql.
