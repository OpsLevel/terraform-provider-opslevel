## v1.4.0 - [February 10, 2025](https://github.com/OpsLevel/terraform-provider-opslevel/compare/v1.3.6...v1.4.0)

This is the first release of the terraform provider with opslevel-go 2025.  This means a bunch of massive under the hood changes.  We don't expect to see many issues with this change as lots of them were caught in our test haress but as with any big change when you switch out the engine unexpected problems might crop up.  Please reachout to your customer success rep and we'll try to get them triaged and fixed ASAP following this release.

### Feature

- Add ability to configure component types
- BREAKING CHANGE: Added 'locked_status' boolean field to resource `opslevel_property_definition` - this field is required and you'll have to set a value for it.

### Bugfix

- Allow opslevel_domain and opslevel_system resources to specify an alias for their owner for the owner

### Dependency

- Bump opslevel-go to 2025
