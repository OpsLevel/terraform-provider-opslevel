## [September 18, 2024](https://github.com/OpsLevel/terraform-provider-opslevel/compare/v1.2.7...v1.3.0)
### Bugfix
- no longer delete service tags during updates when other fields are changed
- BREAKING CHANGE - Changed the default value of field `ownership_tag_keys` in `opslevel_integration_azure_resources` to match the default of the GraphQL API (and the other infrastructure integration resource). This may cause the existing integration to revert any manual changes to `ownership_tag_keys` on the next plan/apply.
### Feature
- Adds support for setting the 'note' field on an 'opslevel_service' resource
### Refactor
- ownership_tag_overrides field now optional in opslevel_integration_aws resource
- ownership_tag_keys in opslevel_integration_azure_resources was a set type, now a list type
### Dependency
- bump opslevel-go to v2024.9.18
