### Bugfix
- Fixed bug in filter predicates where making some filters like on repository_ids was impossible because of bool 'case_sensitive' being required. To toggle case_sensitive use 'case_sensitive = true' or 'case_insensitive = true'. A bug still persists where case sensitivity cannot be disabled when updating a predicate. The workaround is to manually set the predicate to null in Graphiql.
- Fixed bug in filters where the connective was not able to be omitted. A bug still persists where once the optional 'connective' value is set it cannot be unset to null, only changed to 'and' and 'or'. To workaround this you can set 'connective' to null in Graphiql.
- on property_assignment resources the fields owner and definition can use alias not just id, fix an infinite plan bug because we store the wrong thing into the terraform state
- Fix bug where aliases was required for Team resource and aliases contained the slug
