# opslevel_relationship_assignment (Resource)

A relationship assignment in OpsLevel defines a connection between two resources. It specifies:
- The source resource (where the relationship starts)
- The target resource (where the relationship points to)
- The type of relationship (belongs_to, depends_on, or related_to)
- Optionally, a user defined relationship definition (required for related_to type)

## Notes

- For `type`:
  - `belongs_to` and `depends_on` are predefined relationship types that don't require a relationship definition
  - `related_to` requires a `definition` to be specified
- The relationship definition must be created using the `opslevel_relationship_definition` resource first.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Infrastructure resource relationship using
resource "opslevel_relationship_assignment" "basic" {
  source = opslevel_service.example.id        # Component ID
  target = opslevel_infrastructure.example.id # Infrastructure ID
  type   = "belongs_to"                       # One of: belongs_to, depends_on
}

# Component relationship using a relationship definition
resource "opslevel_relationship_definition" "example" {
  name           = "Example"
  alias          = "example"
  component_type = "service"
  allowed_types  = ["service"]
}

resource "opslevel_relationship_assignment" "custom" {
  source     = opslevel_service.example.id
  target     = opslevel_service.other.id
  type       = "related_to"
  definition = opslevel_relationship_definition.example.id
}
```
