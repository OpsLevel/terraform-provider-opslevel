# opslevel_relationship_definition (Resource)

A relationship definition in OpsLevel defines how different resources can be related to each other. It specifies:
- Which component type the relationship is on
- What types of resources can be related (allowed_types)

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "opslevel_relationship_definition" "example" {
  name               = "Example Relationship"
  alias              = "example_relationship"
  description        = "An example relationship definition"
  component_type     = "service" # This should be a valid component type alias from your OpsLevel account
  allowed_categories = ["infrastructure"]
  allowed_types      = ["service", "library", "team"] # Valid types this relationship can target, component alias or 'team'
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `alias` (String) The unique identifier of the relationship.
- `component_type` (String) The component type that the relationship belongs to. Must be a valid component type alias from your OpsLevel account or 'team'.
- `name` (String) The display name of the relationship definition.

### Optional

- `allowed_categories` (List of String) The categories of resources that can be selected for this relationship definition. Can include any component category alias on your account.
- `allowed_types` (List of String) The types of resources that can be selected for this relationship definition. Can include any component type alias on your account or 'team' or 'user'.
- `description` (String) The description of the relationship definition.
- `management_rules` (Attributes List) Rules that automatically manage relationships based on property matching conditions. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--management_rules))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedatt--management_rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `management_rules`

Required:

- `operator` (String) The condition operator for this rule. Either EQUALS or ARRAY_CONTAINS.
- `source_property` (String) The property on the source component to evaluate.
- `target_property` (String) The property on the target resource to match against.

Optional:

- `source_tag_key` (String) When source_property is 'tag', this specifies the tag key to match. Required if source_property is 'tag', must not be set otherwise.
- `source_tag_operation` (String) When source_property is 'tag', this specifies the matching operation. Either 'equals' or 'starts_with'. Defaults to 'equals'. Required if source_property is 'tag', must not be set otherwise
- `target_category` (String) The category of the target resource. Either target_category or target_type must be specified, but not both.
- `target_tag_key` (String) When target_property is 'tag', this specifies the tag key to match. Required if target_property is 'tag', must not be set otherwise.
- `target_tag_operation` (String) When target_property is 'tag', this specifies the matching operation. Either 'equals' or 'starts_with'. Defaults to 'equals'. Required if target_property is 'tag', must not be set otherwise.
- `target_type` (String) The type of the target resource. Either target_category or target_type must be specified, but not both.
